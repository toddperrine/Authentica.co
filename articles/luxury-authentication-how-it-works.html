      <h1>How authentication works in luxury goods</h1>

      <p>
        Luxury authentication is a combination of construction knowledge, reference archives, and adversarial thinking. The best
        authenticators don’t just check whether something looks right; they check whether it can survive a skeptical audit.
      </p>

      <h2>What typically gets checked</h2>
      <ul class="list">
        <li><strong>Materials:</strong> leather, hardware, stitching, adhesives, inks, and manufacturing tolerances.</li>
        <li><strong>Construction:</strong> seams, alignment, symmetry, weight, wear patterns, and assembly consistency.</li>
        <li><strong>Identifiers:</strong> serial formats, date codes, stamps, engravings—interpreted in era context.</li>
        <li><strong>Packaging and collateral:</strong> boxes, dust bags, receipts (useful, but frequently forged).</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>What often gets missed</h2>
      <ul class="list">
        <li><strong>Context:</strong> whether the seller’s story aligns with market availability and known release patterns.</li>
        <li><strong>Custody:</strong> how the item moved across owners (especially important for “too good to be true” deals).</li>
        <li><strong>Documentation integrity:</strong> whether receipts and papers can be corroborated independently.</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="callout">
        <strong>Key idea:</strong> Authentication is not only object-checking. It is story-checking against external reality.
      </div>

      <h2>Questions to ask an authentication service</h2>
      <ul class="list">
        <li>Do you perform physical inspection, digital review, or both?</li>
        <li>What reference archives do you use?</li>
        <li>How do you handle uncertainty (probabilistic vs definitive output)?</li>
        <li>Do you produce an audit record of what was checked?</li>
        <li>What are your known failure modes?</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>How to think about results</h2>
      <p>
        Treat results as decision support. If you have weak provenance or a high-value transaction, consider redundancy: independent
        verification from a second party or a platform guarantee. The point is not perfection; it’s reducing downside.
      </p>

      <div class="callout">
        <strong>Practical next step:</strong> Start with a short directory and choose based on method clarity.
