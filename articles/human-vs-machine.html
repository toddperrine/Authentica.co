      <h1>Human judgment vs machine verification</h1>

      <p>
        Verification tools are improving quickly. But authenticity is adversarial: once a method becomes common, counterfeiters
        adapt. The result is a pattern you see across categories: machines help with scale and consistency; humans help with context,
        judgment, and adversarial thinking.
      </p>

      <h2>Where machines help</h2>
      <ul class="list">
        <li><strong>Consistency:</strong> applying the same checks across large volumes.</li>
        <li><strong>Pattern detection:</strong> identifying anomalies in images, text, or metadata.</li>
        <li><strong>Workflow:</strong> documenting what was checked and producing an auditable record.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Where machines mislead</h2>
      <ul class="list">
        <li><strong>False confidence:</strong> a “score” without method transparency becomes persuasion.</li>
        <li><strong>Input fragility:</strong> low-quality photos and missing records can yield confident nonsense.</li>
        <li><strong>Adversarial adaptation:</strong> counterfeits evolve to exploit known model weaknesses.</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="callout">
        <strong>Rule of thumb:</strong> If a tool cannot explain what it checked and what it did not check, treat the output as a hint, not proof.
      </div>

      <h2>Why hybrid models are emerging</h2>
      <p>
        Hybrid models combine structured machine checks with human review, especially for high-value items. Machines reduce labor,
        humans provide accountability and adversarial reasoning.
      </p>

      <h2>What to ask a service (machine or human)</h2>
      <ul class="list">
        <li>What is your method, step-by-step?</li>
        <li>What inputs do you require (photos, records, custody history)?</li>
        <li>What does your result mean (probabilistic vs definitive)?</li>
        <li>What are known failure modes?</li>
        <li>Do you retain an auditable record?</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="callout">
        <strong>Practical next step:</strong> Choose services that are method-forward, not score-forward.
