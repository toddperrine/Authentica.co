      <h1>Provenance vs authentication</h1>

      <p>
        People often use “provenance” and “authentication” interchangeably. They are related but distinct:
        one is an evidence trail; the other is a verification act.
      </p>

      <div class="callout">
        <strong>Simple distinction:</strong> Authentication asks “Is this real?” Provenance asks “Can we prove where this came from?”
      </div>

      <h2>Authentication is a method</h2>
      <p>
        Authentication is the act of checking an item against a method: inspection, material analysis, archival comparison, expert
        opinion, or transaction-based verification. It can be rigorous or superficial. It can be independent or conflicted.
      </p>

      <h2>Provenance is an evidence trail</h2>
      <p>
        Provenance is the history of the item: records, custody, and independent corroboration. Good provenance reduces ambiguity.
        Weak provenance increases dependence on inspection alone.
      </p>

      <h2>Why provenance is the higher-order signal</h2>
      <p>
        The best counterfeits aim to defeat inspection by matching surface details. Provenance is harder to fake consistently across
        time. A coherent evidence trail creates friction for counterfeiters.
      </p>

      <h2>How they work together</h2>
      <ul class="list">
        <li><strong>Strong provenance + inspection</strong> is the most durable pairing.</li>
        <li><strong>Weak provenance</strong> increases reliance on independent inspection and method transparency.</li>
        <li><strong>No provenance</strong> does not mean fake—but it raises the standard of inspection and skepticism.</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="callout">
        <strong>Practical next step:</strong> Choose services that explain their method and limitations clearly.
