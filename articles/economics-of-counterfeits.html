      <h1>The economics of counterfeits</h1>

      <p>
        Counterfeits are often framed as a moral problem. In practice, they are an incentive problem. When the profit is high,
        the probability of enforcement is low, and buyers are motivated by scarcity or status, fakes flourish.
      </p>

      <h2>Why high-end markets attract high-end fakes</h2>
      <p>
        High-end categories create a large spread between cost-to-produce and market price. That spread funds sophistication: better
        materials, better packaging, better stories, better documentation. The object and its supporting evidence are both targeted.
      </p>

      <h2>Verification is a tax on the market</h2>
      <p>
        In counterfeit-heavy markets, verification becomes a necessary “tax” buyers and sellers pay to transact safely. The more
        counterfeits, the higher the verification tax. Over time, the market reorganizes around it: escrow, inspections, third-party
        authentication, and platform guarantees.
      </p>

      <h2>Why “trust me” persists</h2>
      <p>
        Trust shortcuts are cheaper than verification. Sellers benefit from low friction. Buyers want closure. That gap is where
        counterfeiters operate: they provide persuasive closure at low cost.
      </p>

      <div class="callout">
        <strong>Implication:</strong> If a market has scarcity + status + remote transactions, assume verification will be required.
      </div>

      <h2>What reduces counterfeit pressure</h2>
      <ul class="list">
        <li><strong>Auditability:</strong> methods and records that can be checked independently.</li>
        <li><strong>Custody transparency:</strong> chain-of-custody clarity reduces ambiguity.</li>
        <li><strong>Aligned incentives:</strong> third-party services that benefit from accuracy, not sales.</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="callout">
        <strong>Practical next step:</strong> Treat verification as part of transaction cost, not an optional add-on.
