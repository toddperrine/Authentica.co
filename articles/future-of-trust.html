      <h1>The future of trust and verification</h1>

      <p>
        Trust systems evolve when adversaries evolve. As evidence becomes easier to fabricate—especially with generative models—the
        structure of proof shifts. Future trust systems will emphasize integrity, auditability, and capture of provenance at creation
        time rather than reconstruction after the fact.
      </p>

      <h2>Provenance signals will move closer to the source</h2>
      <p>
        The most valuable provenance is captured at origin: manufacturing records, creation-time metadata, and custody handoffs that
        are logged as they happen. Retroactive provenance is always weaker because it can be assembled to fit a desired story.
      </p>

      <h2>Integrity workflows will matter as much as certificates</h2>
      <p>
        Instead of a single “certificate,” expect workflows that produce audit trails: what was checked, when, by whom, with what
        inputs, and what the system could not verify.
      </p>

      <h2>New failure modes: synthetic evidence</h2>
      <p>
        Generative systems can create plausible receipts, emails, photographs, and narratives. The antidote is not a better story; it
        is corroboration across independent sources and identity-bound records.
      </p>

      <div class="callout">
        <strong>Practical implication:</strong> The more persuasive the evidence looks, the more you should ask whether it is independently corroborated.
      </div>

      <h2>What remains durable</h2>
      <ul class="list">
        <li><strong>Independent inspection</strong> with transparent methods</li>
        <li><strong>Custody records</strong> that are difficult to alter retroactively</li>
        <li><strong>Convergence</strong> across multiple sources</li>
        <li><strong>Aligned incentives</strong> for verification providers</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="callout">
        <strong>Next step:</strong> When you need a service, choose method-forward providers.
