      <p>
        A certificate of authenticity (COA) feels like closure. It looks official. It carries a signature. It suggests finality:
        <em>this is real</em>. The problem is simple: most certificates are easier to counterfeit than the objects they certify.
      </p>

      <h2>Certificates fail because they’re separable</h2>
      <p>
        A paper certificate can be copied, photographed, reprinted, and paired with a different object. Even a digital certificate
        can be duplicated if it lacks strong verification and identity binding.
      </p>

      <h2>Certificates fail because they’re rarely auditable</h2>
      <p>
        A certificate only matters if you can independently verify who issued it, what method they used, and whether they stand
        behind it. Many COAs can’t answer those questions. They are assertions, not evidence.
      </p>

      <h2>Certificates fail because the issuer may be conflicted</h2>
      <p>
        If the issuer benefits from a sale, their certificate is not independent. That doesn’t automatically make it wrong—but it
        does mean you should demand method transparency and corroborating evidence.
      </p>

      <h2>Certificates fail because they can be true and still useless</h2>
      <p>
        A COA might be genuine, but too vague to be meaningful: no serial detail, no reference set, no method, no date, no clear
        object identity. It becomes a token of confidence, not a verification artifact.
      </p>

      <div class="callout">
        <strong>Better standard:</strong> A certificate should be the last page of a file, not the whole file.
      </div>

      <h2>What to rely on instead</h2>
      <ul class="list">
        <li><strong>Provenance trail:</strong> receipts, records, documented chain of custody.</li>
        <li><strong>Independent inspection:</strong> by a party whose incentives are aligned with accuracy.</li>
        <li><strong>Method clarity:</strong> what was checked and what was not checked.</li>
        <li><strong>Convergence:</strong> multiple signals pointing to the same conclusion.</li>
      </ul>

        <strong>Practical next step:</strong> If you need help choosing a service, start with method clarity.
