      <h1>What actually proves authenticity (and what doesn’t)</h1>

        <span class="badge">Evergreen</span>

      <p>
        “Authentic” is often treated as a vibe: the thing looks right, the story feels plausible, the seller seems confident.
        That is not proof. In high-stakes categories—luxury, art, collectibles, wine, watches—proof is a structure. It is a set
        of signals that agree with each other, survive stress, and can be audited by someone other than the seller.
      </p>

      <div class="callout">
        <strong>Working definition:</strong> Authenticity is the claim. <em>Verification</em> is the method. <em>Provenance</em> is the
        evidence trail that makes the claim durable.
      </div>

      <h2>1) Provenance is the highest-order signal</h2>
      <p>
        Provenance is not a certificate. It’s an evidence trail: receipts, auction records, service records, gallery history,
        shipping documents, photographs, and credible witnesses. It answers a simple question: <em>Where has this object been, and who
        can independently corroborate that?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Provenance is powerful because it is difficult to fabricate consistently. Single documents can be forged; a coherent trail
        across time is harder.
      </p>

      <h2>2) Chain of custody matters more than a story</h2>
      <p>
        A story is a narrative. Chain of custody is a sequence of custody events: who held the item, when, and under what
        conditions. For some categories (wine, collectibles, archival items), custody history can be the difference between “likely”
        and “bankable.”
      </p>

      <h2>3) Independent inspection beats self-attestation</h2>
      <p>
        Inspection should be performed by a party who does not benefit from the result. “Authenticated by the seller” is not
        authentication. Independent inspection combines physical checks (materials, construction, wear patterns) with references
        (known exemplars, brand archives, production-era details).
      </p>

      <h2>4) Reference archives are how experts avoid being persuaded</h2>
      <p>
        The most convincing fakes are convincing because they target human psychology. The antidote is reference: catalogs, archives,
        internal brand documentation, and known exemplars. When experts say “it matches,” they mean it matches a reference set.
      </p>

      <h2>5) The strongest proof is convergence</h2>
      <p>
        In practice, you rarely get a single perfect signal. What you want is convergence: multiple independent signals that point to
        the same conclusion. Provenance aligns with inspection. Serial details align with production era. Service records align with
        observed wear. The item’s story aligns with the market’s record.
      </p>

      <h2>What doesn’t prove authenticity</h2>
      <ul class="list">
        <li><strong>A single certificate</strong> (especially if it can’t be verified independently).</li>
        <li><strong>A seller’s confidence</strong> or “guarantee” without method.</li>
        <li><strong>A screenshot of a database entry</strong> without auditability.</li>
        <li><strong>“It came from a reputable place”</strong> as a substitute for evidence.</li>
        <li><strong>AI-generated analysis</strong> without transparent inputs and limitations.</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="callout">
        <strong>Practical next step:</strong> If you need a service, start with a small list and choose based on method clarity.
