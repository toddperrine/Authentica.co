    <h1>Disclosure &amp; editorial ethics</h1>

    <p class="lede">
      Authentica exists to clarify authentication concepts, tradeoffs, and vendor categories.
      Transparency about how this site operates is essential to that mission.
    </p>

    <h2>Editorial independence</h2>
    <p>
      Authentica does not sell authentication software, perform security audits,
      or provide consulting services. All content is written independently and is not
      sponsored, commissioned, or approved by vendors unless explicitly stated.
    </p>

    <h2>Referral &amp; outbound links</h2>
    <p>
      Some outbound links may be referral or affiliate links. If you click a link
      and later engage with a vendor, Authentica may receive a referral fee.
    </p>
    <p>
      Referral relationships do not influence rankings, inclusion, or editorial conclusions.
      Vendors cannot pay to change content, suppress criticism, or receive favorable treatment.
    </p>

    <h2>Vendor inclusion criteria</h2>
    <p>
      Vendors referenced on this site are included based on relevance to authentication,
      identity, access management, or related security domains. Inclusion does not imply
      endorsement.
    </p>

    <h2>Accuracy &amp; limitations</h2>
    <p>
      Authentication technologies evolve quickly. While Authentica aims to keep content
      accurate and current, no guarantees are made regarding completeness or suitability
      for any specific environment.
    </p>

    <h2>Contact</h2>
    <p>
      Questions, corrections, or concerns about this disclosure or site content can be
      directed to <em>editor@authentica.co</em>.
