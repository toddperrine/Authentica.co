          <h2>Why this matters now</h2>
          <p>
            Counterfeits are more convincing, provenance is easier to forge, and AI can fabricate supporting evidence at scale.
            When the stakes are real, “looks right” is not a standard.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
          <h2>Where authentication breaks</h2>
          <p>
            Paper certificates are copied, databases are incomplete, and conflicts of interest are common. Many verification
            systems are theater: persuasive, but not durable under scrutiny.

        <div class="card">
          <h2>What builds trust</h2>
          <p>
            Trust is constructed from provenance, chain of custody, independent inspection, and transparent methods—often with
            a hybrid of human judgment and specialized tools.

          <p>
            We publish evergreen explainers and maintain a small directory of services and tools people use when they need a
            real answer—not a marketing claim.
